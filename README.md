# Earthquake Mapping

## Project Overview 
  
The Obejctive of the project is to create an Earthquake map with three different maps and add the earthquake overlay . The map should be able to display the overlay as the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates location on the earth and also display the earthqaukes with magnitude greater than 4.5 and see the data on the third map.

## Software 
  Leaflet Java Script, HTML, CSS, MAPBox API.

## Project Description

The view of the Base layer involves :
 - Streets
 - Satellites
 - Dark

 The View of the overlay involves :
 - Locations of small earthquakes
 - Locations of major earthqaukes with magnitude greater than 4.5
 - Earth's tectonic plates boundaries


 The Features of this map involves :
  - Selecting different views of the map like street, satellite or Dark with default being Streets view
  - The user can in addition check or uncheck the overlays based on user preferences
  - The map can be zoomed in or out and scrolled around.
  - User can click on any of the circles and a popup messages displays the magnitude and the location of the earthquake.

#### Note:
 Since the MAPbox API key hasn't been updated in the config.js file the below github.io link isn't fully functional : https://hsurisetti.github.io/Earthquake_Challenge/ . By updating with the config key detail , it would be fully functional.
